<p>
The exact cause of schizophrenia isn't known, but a combination of genetics, environment, and altered brain chemistry and structure may play a role.
<br><br>
Schizophrenia is characterized by thoughts or experiences that seem out of touch with reality, disorganized speech or behavior, and decreased participation in daily activities. Difficulty with concentration and memory may also be present.
<br><br>
Treatment is usually lifelong and often involves a combination of medications, psychotherapy, and coordinated specialty care services.
