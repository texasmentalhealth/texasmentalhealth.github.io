Bulimia is a potentially life-threatening eating disorder.
<br><br>
People with this condition binge eat. They then take steps to avoid weight gain. Most commonly, this means vomiting (purging). But it can also mean excessive exercising or fasting.

Treatments include counseling, medications, and nutrition education.
