<p>
Misophonia may cause a reaction to sounds such as dripping water, chewing, snapping gum, or repetitive noises, such as pencil tapping.
<br><br>
People with misophonia can become irritated, enraged, or even panicked when they hear their trigger sounds.
<br><br>
Treatment might involve therapy or lifestyle recommendations, such as using sound protection or creating "noise-free" zones within living spaces.
